This repository contains a collection of my solutions to programming problems from [Timus Online Judge](https://acm.timus.ru). I have not stopped my practice yet so I am going to keep adding new ones.

All the solutions are grouped by problem identifiers in order to facilitate the search.

I submitted the solutions using 64-bit GNU C++ compiler.
